About

Tasker is a mobile app designed to help users track tasks, meetings, and appointments by using organized to-do lists. In particular, the user can create tasks and organize these tasks into categories. The task creation will allow the user to add due dates, priority, and an additional information section to each task that they create. Once the user has entered some tasks into the app, they are viewable by navigating to the corresponding category page that the task is in. Additionally, the main screen of the app is an aggregate tab that combines all of the userâ€™s tasks that need to be completed, ordered by due date, and priority. 

I designed and created this application in my senior year of undergraduate at Indiana University. I developed this application simultaneously with with my final senior project, The Adventuring Party Planner. This application was created in the course I399: Mobile Application Development as my first foray into Android development and Java.
